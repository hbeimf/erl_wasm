# beam_wasm

Experimental library for compiling [Erlang's BEAM bytecode](http://erlang.org/doc/man/beam_lib.html) into [WebAssembly](https://github.com/webassembly/webassembly).   Provides the modules:

- [x] `wasm_lib`
- [ ] `wasm_compile`
- [ ] `wasm_compile_hook`

## Goals

- Eventually compile Erlang to WebAssembly.
- Eventually compile [Elixir to WebAssembly.](https://github.com/jamen/elixir-wasm)
- To experiment with concurrency in WebAssembly.
